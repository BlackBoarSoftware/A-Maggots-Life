# A Maggot's Life

<p>Unity game entry for the GameDevTV GameJam 2022. "Death is only the beginning".</p>
<p>The basic premise of this game is that you play as a particularly agile fly maggot being born in a carcass.
  In order to pupate, you must quickly use your affinity for launching yourself in the air, to find food while 
  avoiding hazards such as predatory birds and pitfalls.</p>
